    <p>This experiment consists of one task. The following instructions will provide more detail, and you will be given
        a quiz to ensure that you have understood the instructions. After the quiz, you will participate in the decision
        rounds where you will be paid according to your choices.
    </p>
    <h4>Quiz</h4>
    <p>It is important that you understand the instructions before you attempt the quiz. You will need to correctly answer
        the quiz questions before progressing to the rest of the experiment. Thus, it is a good idea to be sure
        you understand the instructions before attempting the quiz. As a reminder, you can always ask questions by
        raising your hand, if you are unclear about any aspect of the instructions.
    </p>
    <h4>Earnings</h4>
    <p>You will earn a payment based on the choices you make in this experiment. To determine the payment, the
        computer will randomly select one of the decision rounds for payment. Your payment will be determined by your choices in
        those rounds, and the choices of a randomly selected opponent from today's session. Importantly, any of the
        decision rounds can be selected for payment. So, you should treat each
        decision round like it will be the one that determines your payment.
    </p>
    <h4>Total earnings</h4>
    <p>Your earnings will consist of two components.
        First, you will earn a show-up payment of {{ participation_fee }} for participating in the experiment.
        Second, you will earn a payment based on both the choices you make, and the choices of another randomly selected participant.
