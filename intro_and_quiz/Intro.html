    <p>Welcome to an experiment at ELFE. </p>
    <p>You are about to participate in a study of decision-making. At the conclusion of the experiment, you will be
        paid for your participation. You will receive payment via a bank transfer. The amount of money you will receive
        depends on your decisions.
    </p>
    <p>In order to use your data for research, you will need to complete the entire experiment. However, your
        participation is voluntary. You may choose to stop participating at any time.
    </p>
    <p>If you do choose to complete the experiment, you will earn a payment depending on your choices---which range from
        £{{min_payment}}-£{{max_payment}}. We ask that you keep yourself free of
        distractions during the experiment. Please turn off your mobile phones for the duration of the experiment.
        In addition, please do not communicate with anyone before you complete the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>If you have any questions or technical issues, please raise your hand and the experimenters will do their best to respond to any
        questions and fix any issues you are experiencing.
    </p>
    <p>Next, we will provide instructions explaining how the experiment works and how you will be paid. As a reminder,
        you will never be lied to during this or any experiment at ELFE. So, in particular, the instructions explaining
        how the experiment works and how you are paid are indeed true.
